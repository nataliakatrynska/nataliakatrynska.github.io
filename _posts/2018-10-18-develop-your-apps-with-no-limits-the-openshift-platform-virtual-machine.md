<span style="font-weight: 400;">Eager to get familiar with the new technology and train yourself as a developer? Today, we’re pleased to announce the general availability of OpenShift in the virtual environment. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e have been working for a while to enable all development teams to build and run the OpenShift platform in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">local DEV cluster</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> environment, so you’re no longer limited with global permissions to the remote cloud.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally, the OpenShift platform runs on RedHat Linux. Since most of the techies use the Windows operating system, we have introduced the VirtualBox as a virtual machine provider that comes along with a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">base Linux image, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CentOS. On top of it, there is the OpenShift platform as well as other required tools such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maven, Git, Java, and CNTLM</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to handle an Internet access via a Sabre corporate proxy. The local image is built using Packer</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and, once it’s set, you can run the mirrored AWS environment locally.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind this is to allow engineers, developers, and all tech experts to make the platform up and running on their own computer and give full control during the development process.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to get some more insight into it? You can either:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grab some coffee and come to our brown bag session when you can freely ask about all aspects of this new technology:</span></li>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to share your experience about the usability of the environment, your overall feelings of the platform, or issues you might face, leave a comment below, so we can share our knowledge with you and other users :).</span>
